# IT6-FINAL-DRILL
Project Description

This project aimed to develop a versatile CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST API tailored for MYSQL databases. Its purpose is to facilitate the creation of an interface that seamlessly connects users to the database, enabling interaction via JSON-formatted data. Through rigorous testing and thoughtful design, this code strives to fulfill its intended functionality reliably, ensuring a robust platform capable of accommodating diverse client needs.
This project used a variety of tools and APIs to ensure compatibility and interoperability with other systems. These tools include MySQL Workbench, Flask-API, Python, and Visual Studio Code. Additionally, particular Python packages, sometimes known as "pip's," were used to speed the development process.
Furthermore, aliases can be assigned to certain pip packages to enhance code readability and conciseness. For example, using 'import request as req' creates a more streamlined and cleaner code structure.
Finally, this project implemented Python's venv (virtual environment) to isolate the code and its dependencies from other projects, minimizing confusion for both the system and users. This practice ensures a more organized and manageable development environment.
In essence, this project not only delivers a powerful tool for database interaction but also embodies a journey of exploration and refinement, encapsulating the spirit of innovation and collaboration inherent in modern software development.





INSTALLATION PROCEDURES: 

To install Flask-SQLAlchemy, requests, Flask-JWT-Extended, and mysql-connector-python, use pip, a Python package manager. Here are the methods for installing these pips:

Open your IDE terminal or command prompt.Type the following command, or you can copy this directly, then paste it in the terminal or command prompt individually and press enter:

pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy

pip install requests

pip install Flask-JWT-Extended

pip install mysql-connector-python

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid installing Python packages globally by making an isolated Python environment. Make sure to activate the flask you installed before running the virtual environment command.
